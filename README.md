### :black_circle: Remember the number

You will be shown a number for a short period of time. It is necessary to remember and reproduce as accurately as possible all the digits of the number.

If the user enters the correct value 4 times in a row, then the difficulty increases by 1 level (three-digit number becomes four-digit, etc. up to six-digit). If the wrong value is entered 4 times in a row, then the difficulty is reduced by 1 (three-digit number is the minimum).

### :black_circle: Schulte table

At the very beginning of the exercise, you need to fix your eyes in the center of the table. Without looking away from the center, using only peripheral vision, you need to find all the numbers in ascending order as quickly as possible.
